The Commerce project is a completed web auction application developed as part of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. Below are the requirements and functionalities implemented in this project:

## Project Summary

The Commerce project involves creating an auction platform where users can create, view, edit, and bid on active auction listings. Additionally, users can add listings to their watchlist, comment on listings, and explore listings by category. The application also includes a Django admin interface for managing listings, comments, and bids.

## Implemented Functionalities

### 1. Models and Django Admin Interface

Models for auction listings, bids, and comments have been implemented. Additionally, the Django admin interface has been configured to allow administrators to manage these models.

### 2. Create Listing

Users can create new auction listings by specifying a title, description, starting price, and optionally an image and category.

### 3. Active Listings Page

The active listings page displays all active auction listings, with details such as title, description, current price, and photo.

### 4. Listing Page

Clicking on a listing allows users to view additional details, bid on the listing (if authenticated), add the listing to their watchlist, and close the auction (if they are the creators of the listing).

### 5. Watchlist

Users can view all listings they have added to their watchlist and click on them to view more details.

### 6. Categories

Users can explore listings by category, facilitating the search for specific products.
